# module_4_challenge

# Description
This module has a coding quiz. When pressing start, the seconds clock will begin and a series of 5 questions will appear one by one. After clicking the answer to the 5th question, the final score will appear (i.e., how much time is left is the score), where the user can put in their initials. The initials and score are saved into local memory, and the user will see a list of the highscores ranked from best highest to lowest score.
